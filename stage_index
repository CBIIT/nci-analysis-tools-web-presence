            This tool has been developed to estimate the risk of progressing to

            assessed via cause-specific survival using SEER*Stat software.The
            cause-specific survival is assumed to follow a mixture-cure model
            and the risk of recurrence is inferred from the survival among the
            non-cured fraction. The cure fraction and parametric survival
            distribution among those not cured are estimated using CanSurv
            software. The current version can handle Weibull and log-logistic
            distributions for the non-cured survival.
