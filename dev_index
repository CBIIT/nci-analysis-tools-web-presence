MAAPster can analyze data from a single experiment that includes multiple samples, and the user may investigate multiple contrasts between groups of samples. Raw CEL files are analyzed using several Bioconductor packages in ‘R’, including limma and oligo.  Output includes quality control plots, differential gene expression analysis, gene expression heatmaps, pathway analysis and single sample GSEA analysis.

                    This tool has been developed to estimate the risk of progressing to distant recurrence using disease-specific survival typically provided by cancer registries. The disease-specific survival is assessed via cause-specific survival using SEER*Stat software.The cause-specific survival is assumed to follow a mixture-cure model and the risk of recurrence is inferred from the survival among the non-cured fraction. The cure fraction and parametric survival distribution among those not cured are estimated using CanSurv software. The current version can handle Weibull and log-logistic distributions for the non-cured survival.

                    A standardized occupation coding tool for computer-assisted epidemiologic research. To assist epidemiological researchers incorporate occupational risk into their studies, SOCcer imports free-text job descriptions and suggests the best-fitting SOC-2010 standardized occupation classification code for each job. The application is not intended to replace expert coders, but rather prioritizes job descriptions that would most benefit from expert coders.
