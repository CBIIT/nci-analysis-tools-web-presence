                    MAAPster is a comprehensive web tool designed by the CCR Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource (CCBR) that performs transcriptome analysis of human or mouse Affymetrix gene expression data.  Samples may be uploaded locally or accessed from published data by entering a GEO Series identification number.  MAAPster can analyze data from a single experiment that includes multiple samples, and the user may investigate multiple contrasts between groups of samples. Raw CEL files are analyzed using several Bioconductor packages in ‘R’, including limma and oligo.  Output includes quality control plots, differential gene expression analysis, gene expression heatmaps, pathway analysis and single sample GSEA analysis.

                    JPSurv is a tool for estimating and presenting survival trend. It can be used to predict survival in any given year and any time interval. Two implemented statistical methods are joinpoint survival model and trend measures. Five supported types of trend measures are Annual percentage changes of hazard, Annual percentage changes of cumulative relative survival, Annual changes of cumulative relative survival, Average annual absolute percent changes, and Average annual relative percent changes.

                    This tool has been developed to estimate the risk of progressing to distant recurrence using disease-specific survival typically provided by cancer registries. The disease-specific survival is assessed via cause-specific survival using SEER*Stat software.The cause-specific survival is assumed to follow a mixture-cure model and the risk of recurrence is inferred from the survival among the non-cured fraction. The cure fraction and parametric survival distribution among those not cured are estimated using CanSurv software. The current version can handle Weibull and log-logistic distributions for the non-cured survival.

                    Age-Period-Cohort analysis identifies patterns in cancer incidence or mortality rates from population-based Count (numerator) and Population (denominator) data. Often the data come from a Cancer Registry (e.g., SEER) in the form of a table showing the numbers of cancer cases or cancer deaths (counts) and corresponding person-years at risk (population) for particular age groups and calendar time periods. This toolset provides a comprehensive solution to age-period-cohort analysis for cancer endpoints in defined populations and time periods.</div>

The toolset will show quantities for which people's intuition is poor, such as need for high specificity for a single marker of a rare disease to improve management by some serious intervention.

                        The toolset will allow to evaluate the feasibility of biomarkers called promising before they get press office attention; investigators spend efforts on hopeless pursuit; wasteful. unethical clinical testing begins. Thus, using these strategies will allow focusing on the most promising markers early on, making specific improvements if required, or abandoning markers that are most likely to fail.

The Crosstalk tool aims at testing the differences between two hazards, e.g. the same cancer in different populations or different cancers in the same population.
