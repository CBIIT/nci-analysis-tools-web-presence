            Annual percentage changes of hazard, Annual percentage changes of
            cumulative relative survival, Annual changes of cumulative relative
            survival, Average annual absolute percent changes, and Average

            assessed via cause-specific survival using SEER*Stat software.The
            cause-specific survival is assumed to follow a mixture-cure model
            and the risk of recurrence is inferred from the survival among the
            non-cured fraction. The cure fraction and parametric survival
            distribution among those not cured are estimated using CanSurv
            software. The current version can handle Weibull and log-logistic
            distributions for the non-cured survival.

            cancer cases or cancer deaths (counts) and corresponding

            The Melanoma Risk Assessment is an interactive tool designed by
            scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the University of
            Pennsylvania, and the University of California, San Francisco, to
            estimate a person's absolute risk of developing invasive melanoma.
            The tool helps clinicians identify individuals at increased risk of
            melanoma in order to plan appropriate screening interventions with
            them.

            (DN) are atypical moles that are important risk markers for
            melanoma, and precursor lesions for some melanomas.

            precursors are often discovered through screening, collected data

            A standardized occupation coding tool for computer-assisted
            epidemiologic research. To assist epidemiological researchers
            incorporate occupational risk into their studies, SOCcer imports
            free-text job descriptions and suggests the best-fitting SOC-2010
            standardized occupation classification code for each job. The
            application is not intended to replace expert coders, but rather
            prioritizes job descriptions that would most benefit from expert
            coders.
